cihtodo 0.1; written by fractalcat (sio@tesser.org)

cihtodo ('crap I have to do') is a small Python/Django todo list application
that doesn't do all that much (I prefer it that way). What it does do is
todo-trees and hashtags. I wrote it 'cause I wanted a todolist that didn't suck
(as defined by me); releasing it on the off-chance that someone finds it
useful. 

REQUIREMENTS:

python (>=2.7&&<3.0)
django (written for 1.3, but will probably work with others)
some kind of database

USAGE:

Deploy with webserver and database backend of choice; alternatively, it should work out of the box on localhost/sqlite3:

cd cihtodo
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver
